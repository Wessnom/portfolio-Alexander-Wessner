# Alexander Wessner


I am a guy in my late twenties whos walked different paths in life. I have studied computer science at Gothenburg University, Electrical Engineering at Chalmers University, worked at Volvos Main Shipping facility in Torslanda, Gothenburg, and I have also worked as a preschool teacher at a Catholic school. 

None of my previous academic routes ended up in a degree but I have learned many things and met many people along the way. I am hopeful that enrolling to IT-HÃ¶gskolan will be a good way to move past my previous letdowns from the oldschool ways of Universities.
